    <img src="../images/Chicken-Tikka-Masala-Image.jpg" alt="chicken tikka masala image featuring vibrant, tender chunks of charred orange-red marinated chicken submerged in a thick, creamy, tomato-based sauce">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The gravy often appears <em>glossy</em>, <em>orange-red</em>, or <em>deep orange</em>, 
        garnished with fresh green coriander leaves and a swirl of cream. 
        It is usually served in a shallow bowl alongside fluffy white basmati rice or flatbreads like naan.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken</strong>: Boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cubed.</li>
        <li><strong>Yogurt</strong>: Plain yogurt (Greek or natural)</li>
        <li><strong>Spices</strong>: Which include ginger, garlic, cumin, coriander, turmeric and chili</li>
        <li><strong>Onions</strong>: Red Onion</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato</strong>: Tomato purée</li>
        <li><strong>Coconut milk</strong>: Any brand</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh cilantro</strong>: For garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <strong>Marinate the chicken</strong>
        <li><em>Prepare Chicken</em>: Cut the chicken into inch bite-sized cubes</li>
        <li><em>Mix Marinade</em>: In a large bowl, whisk together the yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, and spices (garam masala, turmeric, cumin, coriander, and chili powder).</li>
        <li><em>Combine &amp; Chill</em>: Toss the chicken pieces in the marinade until fully coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least <em>1 hour</em>, though <em>8 to 24 hours</em> is best for the most tender results.</li>
   <strong>Cook the "Tikka" (Chicken)</strong>
        <li><em>Char the Meat</em>: For a traditional smoky flavour, thread the chicken onto skewers and grill or broil at a high heat (approx. 230°C/450°F) for <em>10 to 15 minutes</em> until slightly charred on the edges.</li>
        <li><em>Alternatives</em>: You can also sauté the chicken in a hot pan with a little oil until browned on all sides. It does not need to be fully cooked through yet, as it will finish in the sauce.</li>
    <strong>Prepare the Masala Sauce</strong>
    <li><em>Sauté Aromatics</em>: Heat ghee or oil in a large pan. Add finely chopped onions and cook for <em>5 to 10 minutes</em> until soft and golden. Stir in more ginger-garlic paste and cook for another minute.</li>
    <li><em>Toast Spices</em>: Stir in the sauce spices (cumin, coriander, paprika, and garam masala) and toast for <em>30 to 60 seconds</em> until fragrant.</li>
    <li><em>Simmer Base</em>: Pour in the tomato purée or chopped tomatoes. Let the sauce simmer on medium-low heat for <em>10 to 15 minutes</em> until it thickens and the oil begins to separate from the sauce.</li>
    <strong>Combine and Finish</strong>
    <li><em>Add Chicken</em>: Stir the grilled or sautéed chicken pieces (and any resting juices) into the simmering sauce.</li>
    <li><em>Make it Creamy</em>: Stir in the heavy cream and a pinch of sugar (if needed to balance the acidity). Simmer for an additional <em>5 minutes</em> until the chicken is fully cooked and tender.</li>
    <li><em>Garnish</em>: Stir in crushed dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi) and top with fresh coriander. Serve hot with basmati rice or naan.</li>
    </ol>
