    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A cheeseburger is a classic hot sandwich consisting of a grilled or pan-fried ground beef patty topped with melted cheese, served between two halves of a bun.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Beef Patty</strong>: 500g (1 lb) Ground beef (80% lean/20% fat)</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: American, Cheddar, or Swiss are popular choices that melt well.</li>
        <li><strong>Bun</strong>: Typically a soft hamburger bun, often sesame seed, toasted or plain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Prepare the Patties</em>: Divide 500g of beef into 4 equal portions and gently shape them into balls, then press into patties about 1-2cm thick. Make the patties slightly wider than the buns to account for shrinkage. <em>Pro tip: Use your thumb to make a slight indentation in the center of each patty to prevent them from doming while cooking.</em></li>
        <li><em>Season</em>: Combine the yeast mixture with flour, salt, and olive oil. Knead the dough by hand for <em>8 to 10 minutes</em> or in a mixer for <em>7 to 10 minutes</em> until it is smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li><em>Preheat the Pan/Grill</em>: Heat a cast-iron skillet or barbecue to high heat. Add a small amount of oil.</li>
        <li><em>Preheat Oven</em>: Place patties in the hot pan. Cook for 3-4 minutes on the first side until a deep, brown crust forms.</li>
        <li><em>Flip and Melt Cheese</em>: Flip the patties once (do not press down on them, as this squeezes out juices). Immediately top with cheese slices. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the burger is cooked through.</li>
        <li><em>Toast Buns</em>: While the burgers cook, toast the buns (cut side down) in the pan or on the grill until golden.</li>
        <li><em>Assemble</em>: Build your burger with the base bun, followed by the patty with melted cheese, and top with your desired condiments and vegetables.</li>
        <li><em>Rest and Serve</em>: Let the burgers rest for 2-3 minutes before serving to ensure they are juicy. </li>
    </ol>
