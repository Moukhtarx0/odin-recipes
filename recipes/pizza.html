    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza is a globally popular Italian dish featuring a flattened, leavened bread base topped with savory ingredients, most commonly tomato sauce and cheese (typically mozzarella), baked at high temperatures. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dough (Base)</strong>: Typically made from all-purpose or bread flour, water, yeast, salt, and olive oil. Some recipes add sugar for yeast activation or cornmeal for a crisp texture on the bottom. </li>
        <li><strong>Sauce</strong>: The standard is a tomato-based sauce, often enhanced with crushed tomatoes, garlic, onion, olive oil, and dried herbs like basil or oregano. White pizzas may use Alfredo or olive oil instead of tomato sauce. </li>
        <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: Low-moisture mozzarella is preferred for melting, though fresh mozzarella is common for Neapolitan styles. Other popular cheeses include parmesan, provolone, fontina, gorgonzola, and goat cheese. </li>
        <li><strong>Toppings (Optional)</strong>:  Sliced onions, mushrooms, bell peppers, black olives, pineapple, and spinach</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <strong>Prepare and Rise the Dough</strong>
        <li><em>Activate Yeast</em>: Mix warm water with yeast and a pinch of sugar. Let it sit for about <em>5 to 10 minutes</em> until it becomes frothy.</li>
        <li><em>Mix and Knead</em>: Combine the yeast mixture with flour, salt, and olive oil. Knead the dough by hand for <em>8 to 10 minutes</em> or in a mixer for <em>7 to 10 minutes</em> until it is smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li><em>First Rise</em>: Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover it with a damp towel, and let it rise in a warm spot for 1 to 2 hours until it doubles in size.</li>
   <strong>Shape and Top</strong>
        <li><em>Preheat Oven</em>: Set your oven to its highest setting typically 450°F to 500°F (230°C to 260°C). If using a pizza stone, preheat it for <em>at least 30 minutes.</em></li>
        <li><em>Stretch the Dough</em>: On a floured surface, gently press and stretch the dough into a circle about <em>10 to 12 inches wide</em>. Avoid using a rolling pin if you want a puffier crust.</li>
        <li><em>Add Toppings</em>: Spread a thin layer of sauce, leaving a 1-inch border for the crust. Add cheese and your chosen toppings. Be careful not to overload the pizza, or it may become soggy.</li>
    <strong>Bake and Serve</strong>
    <li><em>Bake</em>: Slide the pizza onto a preheated stone or baking tray. Bake for <em>8 to 15 minutes</em> depending on the temperature, until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling.</li>
    <li><em>Finish</em>: Let the pizza rest for <em>2 to 3 minutes</em> before slicing to allow the cheese to set. </li>
    </ol>
